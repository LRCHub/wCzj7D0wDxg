Omoi wa oku fukaku
Uta ni komeru mono
Muyamini hakidaseba
Tada no otoni kudaru

Kotobawa jisuzou wo
Motazu jiyuuna mono
Kazaritate kakagereba
Tayasuku uso ni kawaru

Haru wo matsu
Akai gaaberani
Koi wo shita
Koorogi

Shabon ni hajiketa
Ikusen no uta wo
Kokoro kakinarashi utau
Anata no tameni

Sakebeyo Utaeyo
Sono fukaki ai wo
Inochi furuwasete utau
Enma koorogiyo

Kuruoshii... shinzo-ono kotoba
Kimi ni ima okurou

Uta wa shabonni hajiketa
Kazega honkondeku
Iradachinimo nita aito
Kazaranu kotoba

Sakebeyo Utaeyo
Kono fukaki aiwo
Inochi furuwasete utau
Konya... kimi no tame ni

English Translations 1:

Feelings are things that are planted
In the dept of songs
To sing them heartlessly
Just transforms them in simple sounds

Words are indepenent objects
Without a body
Beautified, enforced
They transform quickly to lies

Wait for the spring time
Cricket in love
With the red
Gerbera

These ten thousand arias,
Caught in the soap
Make your heart swelling,
How it sounds,
how it sings- for you.

Scream it out, Sing it,
This deep love
Sing it and let it swing your life,
Infernal cricket

These words... from this crazy heart,
I dedicate them to you

The song is caught in the soap
Carries by the wind
These words, decorated with a love
Alsmot frustrated

Scream it out, Sing it out,
This deep love
Sing it and let this night
Swing your life... for yourself

English Translations 2:

I'm someone who puts
his deepest thoughts into poems
To just spit out everything without thinking
would make the music around in vain

The words don'r come with a real image,
I'm free
Beautified and published
They're turning to lies quite easily

I'm waiting for the spring.
The red Gerbera,
Being in love,
Crickets

Soap bubbles bursting
into a thousand poems
I'm singing,
Letting my heart
Sound- for you

Call Out! Sing about
this deep love!
Let our life quake
with your singing,
Enma cricket

I wat to give the words of my heart to you,
Obsessively, now

Thsi poem is bursting soap bubbles
Being carried by the breeze
About anger as well love
and the words are not beautified

Cry out! Sing about
this deep love!
I'm letting our life quake
with singing, this night, for you.
